# AtliQ-Business360

## Project Overview

AtliQ Hardware is growing rapidly in the recent years, and they have decided to implement the data analytics using PowerBi in their company for the first time to surpass their competitors in the market and to make data driven decisions. This project is hoped to give answers to the questions of stakeholder in terms all the aspects like finance, sales, marketing and supply chain.

I worked on this project by following the Codebasics PowerBi Course.

## Importing data into PowerBi

- As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from Mysql database to PowerBi by providing the Database access credential

## Data Model

- Data modeling plays a vital role and is considered as the basement of report. All the visuals will be build upon the data model.
- Poor data modeling affects the over all performance of the report.
- In this project, we have followed Snowfall data modeling method.

### Dashboard designing

Based on the mock ups received as requirement, the team will start designing the visuals and create measure as and when required

## Project Outcome

By using this report, decisions can be taken based on the data. Further it will help in answering n number of why questions based on the situations.
